                <p>A basic page that provides some basic information about malware. It doesn't use any CSS code at all to style the page, so think of "baby's first webpage" if you will.</p>

                <p>A page that showcases a random collection of rubber ducks. It uses CSS code to style up the page so it doesn't look bland and boring. Be sure to read the disclaimer at the very top, very important you read that!</p>

                <p>A page that showcases a rubber duck store, or at least, it's supposed to anyway. It shows different brands of ducks, a section for store favorites based on category, and a small gallery of ducks!</p>

                <p>A page that attempts to recreate the McCausland College of Arts and Sciences webpage from USC. It may not be 1:1, but I had fun making it!</p>
