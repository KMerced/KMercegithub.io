                        <p>This is part 4 of the project which adds color to every page and a background image. Majority of images have been replaced with actual images, but some placeholders still remain as I track down the remaining ducks to get their pictures.</p>

                        <p>This is part 6 of the project. Finally fixed some issues with text overlapping and put all duck into info a database. This way, everything leads to one singular page template and it dynamically updates based on the duck you clicked on!</p>

                    <p>This is part 7 of the project. The site now has a working form where you can enter your email address and it'll send me an email when it's successful. I also added an address as an iframe as a sort of "base of operations," though it isn't actually mine. Would never give my real address like that.</p>
