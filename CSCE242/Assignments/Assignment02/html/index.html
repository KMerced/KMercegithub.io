            <h1>A Rubber Duck Collection!</h1>

            <h1>Please note this is not my actual collection of ducks.</h1>

            <h2>By Brand</h2>
    
           <h2>Bullseye's Playground (Target)</h2>
           <h3>Halloween Collection (2022)</h3>
           <img src="../images/TargetHalloweenDucks.jpg">
           <p>Special Notes: Glad I got these when I did, there were barely any left when I arrived at Target. If I had come any later, they'd have completely sold out. Really good ducks this year though. Personal favorite: The skeleton one!</p>

           <h2>Infantino</h2>
           <h3>Gray Fun Time Racer Duck</h3>
           <img src="../images/GreyFlamesDuck.jpg">
           <p>Special Notes: Picked this one up on Ebay for $6 (not including shipping). It wasn't available anywhere else, so I assume it's one of the rarer ones. Tried to look up info about the duck, but didn't find anything. Oh well, good duck regardless!</p>
           <h3>Halloween Pumpkin Duck</h3>
           <img src="../images/HalloweenPumpkinDuck.jpg">
           <p>Special Notes: Another pick up from Ebay, paid about $3 for it (not including shipping). It's one of the better ducks Infantino has put out in my opinion. Plus, it's a Halloween duck, so I automatically love it!</p>
