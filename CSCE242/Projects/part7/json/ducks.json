Skyrim is my favorite videogame of all time, so when I heard this duck existed in their lineup, I knew I had to pick it up. Seeing this duck really brings back memories of playing Skyrim when I was in middle school. It reminds me of simpler times when you came home from school, rushed to finish your math homework, then turned on the Xbox 360 to start playing. The memories of walking around the roads of Whiterun hold and listening to 'From Past to Present' play in the background is an experience you don't get anywhere else. I still play the game today, ableit heavily modded to make up for the game's flaws. I plan to buy the bigger boxed edition of this duck in the future as well!",
