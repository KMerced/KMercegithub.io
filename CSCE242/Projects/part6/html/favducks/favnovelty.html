                <h3>Why is it my favorite?:</h3>
                <p>In my opinion, this duck looks cooler than the rest of the novelty ducks in my collection. There's something about the red bandana and black bowler hat that speak to me more than the others. Maybe it's just my like for mobster movies that's leaking in.</p>
