            <p>I don't remember the exact date I got this duck, but I know it was during the yearly Halloween event that was held at the big gym at Fort Jackson. If you won their version of Bobbing For Apples (which has rubber ducks in the water instead of apples), you got to keep the duck you "bobbed" for!</p>
