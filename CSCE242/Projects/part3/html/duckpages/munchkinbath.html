            <p>I'll be honest here, I have no clue when I got this duck. I do remember though, that my mom would put this duck in the bathtub when I was in there for my younger self to play with. If the water became too hot, the "HOT" base at the bottom would show it's color a bit. Funnily though, I remember this happening a lot with the duck so either the duck was giving false alarms, or the water was genuinely hot.</p>
