            <h3>Story:</h3>
            <p>I don't remember the exact date I got this duck, but I know it was during the yearly Halloween event that was held at the big gym at Fort Jackson. I believe I won this by winning a game that wasn't the Bobbing For Apples one. I believe they sometimes gave out ducks as a prize if you won a game.</p>
