            <h3>Story:</h3>
            <p>This was the first of the Halloween ducks I got for 2025. I rushed to buy the whole set of ducks the moment I saw they were available on the Target website (as they tend to sell out within days at my local Target). I went as soon as I was done with all my classes and there were barely any left, likely bought up by scalpers. I was lucky that there were still enough to get the full set of 5. Had I come the next day, I'm confident the store would've sold out.</p>
