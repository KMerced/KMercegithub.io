            <p>I don't have an idea when I got this duck either, but I at least have a guess for this duck. I think these used to be sold at Walmart in packs of 3 and my mom bought one for me when I was a toddler. My mom told me that every time I saw rubber ducks while she was shopping, I'd say they were mine and she would have to tell me they actually weren't.</p>
