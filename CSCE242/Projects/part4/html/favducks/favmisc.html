                <h3>Why is it my favorite?:</h3>
                <p>This duck has the exact same situation as my favorite jumbo duck in that since it's the only duck I own in this category, it's my favorite by default. I do have some decent memories with this duck given that they're among the very few memories that I can remember of my early childhood, but I feel that this duck will be easily dethroned by new ducks in the future.</p>
