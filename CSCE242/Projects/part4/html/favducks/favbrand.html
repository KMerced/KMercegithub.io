                <h3>Why is it my favorite?:</h3>
                <p>TESV: Skyrim is my favorite game of all time, full stop. I have so many good memories from my childhood playing this game, and looking at this duck feels like the embodiment of those memories. It brings back the memories of walking through Riverwood and hearing "From Past to Present" play in the background. It is a feeling I don't get with any other duck in my collection, and I even plan to buy the bigger version of this duck in the future.</p>
